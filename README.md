Communicating Climate Change in Style üåçüåéüåè

# 

|¬†Work in progress. This repo is based on a 48 h sciathon and therefore not perfect (yet) |

## Vision

We want to help communicate relevant science on climate change as efficient as possible.

Check out short video on the project: [![Project video](img/video_thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/3t5OFxMSSF0)

## Next Steps

- Improve modularity and reliability of the code
- Add a distinction between climate change sceptic and climate change positive tweets
- 

## What can I do?

**If you are working on communicating climate change** - let us know about your work, contribute your expertise to the project by commenting on the issues below 

**If you are a programer** - help us improve the tool. Contribute ideas by raising issues and commenting on the potential projects. Get to work on the implementation of important features. 
<!-- # TODO: link issue here -->

**If you have questions or suggestions on the project** - reach out to us on twitter: @juzb, 
<!-- #TODO: add your handles, if you're fine with that -->

## What to communicate?

We'd  like to have a discussion about this and hear from you! 
Check out our issue  <!-- TODO: link issue here -->
Help us to figure out
- what are the most urgent messages to convey
- what is the the scientific evidence

## How to communicate?

We'd  like to have a discussion about this and hear from you! 
Check out our issue <!-- TODO: link issue here -->
Help us to figure out
- who needs to hear the messages the most
- how the message should be conveyed to it reaches open ears


# Using the c3s tool

We want to make using our tool as simple as possible. In fact, you can start right now in a colab notebook or locally:

## Colab:
<!-- #TODO: figure out how to make the colab notebook run the newest version from github -->

## Locally:
<!-- Hyperlink all of these -->
1. clone this repository
2. install conda
3. create a conda environment with `tweepy` in `python3`
4. get credentials for the Twitter API
5. run the [notebook](code/sciathon_notebook.ipynb)

## Attributions

This project started off with team Bisztray in the Lindau Nobel Laureate Metings Sciathon 2020:

We are honored to have won the first prize in the sicathon's communicating climate change section amongst many great projects!
